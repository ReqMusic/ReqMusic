## About the Project

This project is a personal project of mine that I'm doing to expand my skills and learn more about web development. The goal of the project to to create a web app that will recommend music to the user. The plan is to utilize Spotify's APIs to achieve this, but I may also look into other methods of recommending music such as artifical intelligence.
